# Football Stock Market

The idea behind this project is to create a web application which gives fantasy football a different perspective. 
Instead of picking players based on their stat totals on either a weekly or seasonly basis, players are treated as stocks.
A player's value is determined by prior efficency, current sitation, upcoming games and a few other factors. 
Using a fictional currency, people will be able to "buy" stocks of these players. 
Based on performance, these stock prices can go up and down. 
So, if player X gets traded to a better situation, their price may rise.
If player Y has a season ending injury, their price will fall, ect. 

Using this method, people will be able to grab players they think will perform better then excpected inorder to increase their portfolios value.
